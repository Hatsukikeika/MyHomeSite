								<h3>Hi, This is Yi.</h3>
								<p>
									“One takes the behavior of one’s company”, this is true about me and my father. My father is an avid computer enthusiast and also a developer, 
									since my childhood, I have been deeply influenced by my father and have been very interested in computers. I came into contact with computers 
									when I was very young and participated in web programming competitions in elementary school. Even though I didn’t win any awards in the 
									competitions, they became the first experiences self-learned computer programming.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    My enthusiasm for computers has never faded, but due to China's unique education method, even after entering middle school, I could only learn 
									computer-related knowledge through some hacking-related books. Soon, my life came to a turning point; my father immigrated to the United States, 
									and I was able to come to the United States for education. I chose as many science-related electives as possible in high school and took a web 
									design course. Eventually, I graduated from high school and attended the computer science department at UNCG.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    A lot of extra-curricular accumulation and practice gave me a good skill sets. Before each programming, I can quickly establish a hypothesis that 
									may reach the correct answer, and try to implement it. With this benefit, in the freshman computer course, I achieved better performance than most 
									students in the same period. In the university course, the professor of software engineering greatly inspired me. I focus on code specifications 
									and extensibility of the code, and continuously improve the code I have. Finally, I made my way to the NCSU, one of the best engineering universities 
									in the US. I started to learn more subjects other than Software Engineering only. I widely attempted all the courses that I believe can be carried 
									forward to the software development engineering, including Cryptographic, Generative Game design, Security, User Privacy, etc.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    Challenges never end. Now, I’m looking for more challenges and I believe the experience and knowledge I have can be the sword that cut off the thorns 
									and broaden my horizons.
								</p>

									<h4>Keywords: <br> Image processing,  TensorFlow,  PYQT,  Python</h4>
								</b>
								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/ORC.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This tool allows users to open an image from the device or write down something by using a mouse on its whiteboard. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Words in the input will be captured and sliced into single letters through Image processing techniques and thresholding.
									After passing the letters into the ML model, the console will display the proper result.

								<b>
									<h4>Keywords: <br> ZMQ,  SFML,  C++</h4>
								</b>
								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/game.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									A simple game engine which builds from the ground up, using a combination of inheritance & composition. 
								</p>
								<p>
									It is simple but comprehensive. It covers Event Systems, Time clock, Replay, External Script Support, and Multiplayer Support. 
									Games created by this game engine include platformer games, bubble shooter, and snake game.
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Automation Tool</h2>
								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/dell.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This project is done during my internship at Dell Technologies, Shanghai. 
									It is a tool that can automatically travel through all the possible action paths within a given window. 
									Unfortunately, I cannot provide further details here due to Dell's Confidentiality Agreement.

								<b>
									<h4>Member: <br> Yi Qiu,  Shiyang Xiao,  Pil Han,  Harman Bains</h4>
									<h4>Keywords: <br> RESTful,  Spring,  JSP,  bootstrap</h4>
									This project was elected to be the best senior capstone of Spring 2020 and displayed in the UNCG's Computer Science Department Building.
								</b>

								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/STposter.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Spartan Trade is a web-based trading system, the purpose is for students & teaching staffs 
									to list their WTS/WTB for any item. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I played an important role in this team, by implementing the API client and helping my team member with both the UI implementation and UI Multi-platform adaptation. 
									And I also helped my team to integrate Front-end, API client, and API endpoint to make this project run as a whole.
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Expertiza: E2115</h2>
								<b>
									<h4>Member: <br> Yi Qiu,  Ryan Smith,  Jose Molina Melendez,  Bahati Wanza</h4>
									<h4>Keywords: <br> Ruby,  Ruby on Rails,  NCSU</h4>
									This project's pull request was approved and merged to NCSU's Expertiza project.
								</b>

								<span class="image main" style="width: 100%;"><img src="images/expertiza.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Expertiza is a web student management system under NCSU and is supported by the National Science Foundation. 
									This application allows students to grade, submit, and peer-review learning objects.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our team provided a solution to the existing issue of expertiza and created an extension to allow the expertiza to
									support more functions (Mentor management for assignments without topics), I played a developer role in this 
									team and provided a well-decoupled code. Our implementation and unit testing passed the review and checking process by 
									the offcial	expertiza team.   
								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Amazing</h2>
								<b>

								<p>
									Amazing is a 2D top-down maze game, the game content is randomly and automatically generated by the level.
									The key algorithm we used for this game is Kruskal spanning tree. In this project, I mainly take charge of 
									handling character's movement, character's collision, and character's interaction with other elements.

								<h2 class="major">WMS Global</h2>
								<b>
									<h4>Member: <br> Yi Qiu,  Larry Guo, SHITOUREN</h4>

								<p>
									WMS Global is a Cross-border e-commerce warehouse management system. It allows the sellers to interact with their warehouse, 
									the actions include sellers uploading labels, sellers moving packages to a new warehouse location, 
									sellers requesting the warehouse to create shipments, etc. This project is not completed yet, and it is temporarily paused due to understaffing. 
									The API backend is almost completed, the integration is around 30% there. The front-end UI needs a refactor which is already on our TODO list.
