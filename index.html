								<h3>Hi, This is Yi.</h3>
								<p>
									I'm a passionate programmer who graduated from NC State University's Graduate School in 2022. I love to spend my effort into coding 
									well-organized code & programs to make them efficient and easy to extend, not only as my career but also as a hobby.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    During my school years, I learned Big Data, Machine Learning, SDE, Computer Vision, etc. Among the many fields of Computer Science, 
                                    I excel in software engineering and participated in both individual and team projects. 
								</p>
								<p>
                                    Besides computers, I also have other hobbies. I have a strong thirst for knowledge that is not limited to computer's, such as Law, Medica, 
                                    hardware, and cooking.
								</p>
								<p>
                                    I'm an Anime fan, analyzing the details of the plot and the way how the story is expressed is also one of my passions. During the communication
                                    with other Anime fans, I found that I have good critical thinking and am willing to accept a different point of view. One of my favorite Anime shows is
                                    "Steins; Gate".

									This application allows students to grade, submit, and peer-review learning objects.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our team provided a solution to the existing issue of expertiza and created an extension to allow the expertiza to
									support more functions (Mentor management for assignments without topics), I played a developer role in this 
									team and provided a well-decoupled code. Our implementation and unit testing passed the review and checking process by 
									the offcial	expertiza team.
